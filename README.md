Symfony Micro Edition
=====================

Welcome to the Symfony Micro Edition - a stripped version of Symfony Standard Edition that you can use as the 
skeleton for your new Api/Small applications.

For install is really simple with Composer:

`composer create-project nunopress/sf-micro-edition project_name`

Difference from Standard Edition?
---------------------------------

I made the stripped/small version of Standard Edition without some bundles and configuration's.

In the few first releases I made a personal version of this with MicroKernel, but I get some feedback so I choose
to come back to the Standard Edition and stripped for make more simple and fast (_with my benchmarks with the same
application get 50% run much fast_).

The result is really nice, fast response, same folders, same code (_made only difference on Kernel_) and you 
ready to come back to standard edition easy, you need only to add into composer the other default packages and 
replace the MicroKernel and MicroCache with AppKernel and AppCache Standard Edition.

What's inside?
--------------

The Symfony Micro Edition is configured with the following defaults:

  * Stripped Symfony AppKernel/AppCache (_renamed MicroKernel/MicroCache_);
